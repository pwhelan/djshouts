    I can not for your data. I might see it, but won't actively look for
    it. If I do I won't save it. Most likely it'll get deleted in between
    development cycles before anyone even uses it. Don't store anything
    that might warp my little mind in the off chance I have to look at it
    for debugging purposes. Whatever I do see dies with me, unless I am
    legally obligated to do otherwise, perhaps... I AM NOT A LAWYER!
